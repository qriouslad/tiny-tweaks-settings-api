# Tiny Tweaks

A simple WordPress plugin to perform small tweaks to the wp-admin footer and the login page. Created as part of [Building Your First Plugin(s) â€“ the Why and How](https://malaysia.wordcamp.org/2024/session/building-your-first-plugins-the-why-and-how/) talk for WordCamp Malaysia 2024. 

This version uses WordPress [Settings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/) to build the settings page. Another version that uses [Codestar framework](https://github.com/Codestar/codestar-framework) can be found at [https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-codestar](https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-codestar).
